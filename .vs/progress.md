# /vs progress log — task_001

Append-only. One block per cycle.

## 2026-04-23 — Planner

Spec drafted. Task: `--json` output for `code-check.py`. Budget: 2 cycles. Test location: `smoke-test.py` (Tester appends, Generator cannot touch the file). User approved.

## 2026-04-23 — task_003 Planner (FUZZY MODE)

User invoked `/vs write a haiku about vibe that could win a prize`. Step 1 simplicity gate tripped on "no verifiable acceptance criteria" — offered the user (a) tighten the brief or (b) `--fuzzy`; user picked `--fuzzy`. First test run of `--fuzzy` mode end-to-end.

Spec drafted: 8 ACs covering syllable count, kireji pivot, concrete imagery, vibe-essence threshold ("at least two of four" elements), banned-word list, standalone readability, originality, file-byte strictness. `HAIKU.md` is the deliverable. Budget 2 cycles.

Spec critic iteration 1: revise (3 concerns — AC8 markdown loophole, AC4 banned-word list too thin, AC4 vibe's-essence threshold absent). All addressed.

Spec critic iteration 2: revise (1 new concern introduced by iteration-1 fix — `shell` was whitelisted as an acceptable poetic word but is itself a project-tagline term). Cap reached; one-word fix applied (added `shell` and `terminal` to banned list, dropped from whitelist). Showing spec to user for approval.

## 2026-04-23 — task_004 Planner

User invoked `/vs develop a cross-org learning library ensure everything is fully anonymised, secure, 100% opt-in and people get to determine where the learning library lives and whether it is public or private.` Step-1 simplicity gate passed (multi-file, security-sensitive, verifiable criteria).

Spec drafted: opt-in via `vibe learn --init`; host-only capture via `vibe learn "<pattern>"` with confirm-before-write; user-chosen library path; private/public visibility (public = user's git repo, push prompt per capture); per-project `.vibe-no-learn` marker; library bind-mounted RO into containers at `/learnings`.

Spec critic iteration 1: revise. **Four blockers** (AC4/AC9 readonly-vs-write contradiction; `--mount` doesn't exist on `devcontainer up`; `install-claude-extras.sh` can't see opt-in state; `vibe learn` dispatch undefined) plus **three security concerns** (commit-message injection; `source` of user-writable config = arbitrary code execution; missing EOF-bypass test). Major revision: dropped in-container slash command for v1 (eliminates 3 of 4 blockers); switched mount mechanism to generated `--override-config` per-session JSON; pinned strict regex parser (no source/eval); pinned `git commit --file=<tempfile>` (no shell-arg injection); added EOF-defaults-to-cancel.

Spec critic iteration 2: **pass**. Five residual Builder-awareness notes; folded the 3 load-bearing ones (override-config used by both `up` + `exec`; `$HOME` unset = fail-safe opted-out; tempfile cleanup via `trap EXIT INT TERM`).

Cap reached cleanly with pass verdict. Showing spec to user.

## 2026-04-23 — task_004 Cycle 1: PASS

- Generator (Sonnet) added 10 AC14 helpers + dispatch + override-config plumbing to `vibe`. +471 lines, single source-tree file.
- Tester (Haiku 4.5, independent) appended 27 test functions / 57 `[learn]`-prefixed checks to `smoke-test.py`, one+ per AC. All pass; no regression in pre-existing tests.
- Evaluator independently verified: shellcheck clean, smoke-test green, security spot-checks pass (config-injection canary not created, $HOME unset returns fail-safe opted-out exit 0), diff scope clean (only `vibe` from Generator + `smoke-test.py` from Tester; `.vs/` and `TODO.md` are Planner's). No project-invariant violations.
- Tester process slip: `summary.md` not written (data was in test-output.log; Evaluator wrote summary.md retroactively).
- cost: 1 cycle, 4 subagent calls, 218,672 tokens (0 opus, 119,821 sonnet, 98,851 haiku), wall 822s.

## 2026-04-23 — task_003 Cycle 1: PASS (FUZZY MODE)

- Generator (Sonnet) wrote `HAIKU.md`:
  ```
  sealed room, one matchstrike —
  a voice rises from the floor
  outside stays outside
  ```
- Reviewer (Sonnet, independent — no access to Generator's report) returned `pass`. All 8 ACs ✓ delivered. Three concerns flagged as competitive-margin: faint ghost-trope register on line 2; no kigo (not required); "outside stays outside" close to slogan territory. None structural.
- Evaluator (me) independently verified syllable count (5/7/5), banned-word grep clean, file-byte audit clean (3 non-empty lines, no front matter), 3+ vibe-essence elements evoked. Concurred with Reviewer's pass; Reviewer's concerns are honest critique, not blockers.
- Diff scope clean: only `HAIKU.md` from Generator (other diff entries are Planner's spec/progress/TODO edits).
- **First end-to-end exercise of `/vs --fuzzy`.** Mode worked as designed: Reviewer produced a thoughtful colleague-style verdict with per-AC assessment + competitive concerns, not rubber-stamp or syllable-pedantry. Step-1 simplicity-gate offer (tighten brief vs `--fuzzy`) presented options cleanly. Spec Critic ran fuzzy-aware (didn't demand mechanical verifiability of haiku quality criteria). Worth keeping as harness regression baseline.

## 2026-04-23 — task_002 ABANDONED at spec-approval stage

Spec drafted for "persistent per-repo container reattach + `--fresh` flag + `VIBE_IDLE_TIMEOUT` idle sweep" (3-cycle budget). Two Spec Critic iterations refined technical detail (helper contracts, sha1 portability, `docker ps` format pinning).

When the polished spec was shown to user, they realised the framing was wrong: the actual goal is **Claude conversation persistence** (`claude --continue` / `--resume`), not container-layer reattach. Container reattach already works via devcontainer CLI labels; idle-timeout solved a problem that didn't matter.

**Lesson:** `/vs` Spec Critic only audits the spec text, not whether the spec solves the user's actual problem. The original framing came from Planner ("container cold-start latency"), user rubber-stamped under "saves time, no token cost," and Critic could only check internal consistency. Saved as feedback memory `feedback_confirm_persistence_meaning.md`.

Replacement work (`vibe --continue` / `--resume` / `--resume <uid>` flags) is small enough to fail the simplicity gate and is being done inline, not through `/vs`.

## 2026-04-23 — Cycle 1: PASS

- Generator (Sonnet) added `argparse` + `--json` to `code-check.py`. New helpers: `get_shellcheck_version()`, `run_json_mode()`. Default human path unchanged.
- Tester (Sonnet, independent) appended 10 test functions / 44 `check()` calls to `smoke-test.py`, one or more per acceptance criterion. All 44 new + 12 pre-existing pass.
- Evaluator independently re-ran `python3 code-check.py`, `python3 code-check.py --json`, `python3 smoke-test.py`, validated JSON schema, confirmed `git diff --stat` shows only `code-check.py` and `smoke-test.py` changed (no shell scripts touched). Generator did not touch test file. Spec criteria 1–10 verified.
- No invariant violations vs `CLAUDE.md § Invariants`.
