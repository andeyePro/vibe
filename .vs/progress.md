# /vs progress log — task_001

Append-only. One block per cycle.

## 2026-04-23 — Planner

Spec drafted. Task: `--json` output for `code-check.py`. Budget: 2 cycles. Test location: `smoke-test.py` (Tester appends, Generator cannot touch the file). User approved.

## 2026-04-23 — task_002 ABANDONED at spec-approval stage

Spec drafted for "persistent per-repo container reattach + `--fresh` flag + `VIBE_IDLE_TIMEOUT` idle sweep" (3-cycle budget). Two Spec Critic iterations refined technical detail (helper contracts, sha1 portability, `docker ps` format pinning).

When the polished spec was shown to user, they realised the framing was wrong: the actual goal is **Claude conversation persistence** (`claude --continue` / `--resume`), not container-layer reattach. Container reattach already works via devcontainer CLI labels; idle-timeout solved a problem that didn't matter.

**Lesson:** `/vs` Spec Critic only audits the spec text, not whether the spec solves the user's actual problem. The original framing came from Planner ("container cold-start latency"), user rubber-stamped under "saves time, no token cost," and Critic could only check internal consistency. Saved as feedback memory `feedback_confirm_persistence_meaning.md`.

Replacement work (`vibe --continue` / `--resume` / `--resume <uid>` flags) is small enough to fail the simplicity gate and is being done inline, not through `/vs`.

## 2026-04-23 — Cycle 1: PASS

- Generator (Sonnet) added `argparse` + `--json` to `code-check.py`. New helpers: `get_shellcheck_version()`, `run_json_mode()`. Default human path unchanged.
- Tester (Sonnet, independent) appended 10 test functions / 44 `check()` calls to `smoke-test.py`, one or more per acceptance criterion. All 44 new + 12 pre-existing pass.
- Evaluator independently re-ran `python3 code-check.py`, `python3 code-check.py --json`, `python3 smoke-test.py`, validated JSON schema, confirmed `git diff --stat` shows only `code-check.py` and `smoke-test.py` changed (no shell scripts touched). Generator did not touch test file. Spec criteria 1–10 verified.
- No invariant violations vs `CLAUDE.md § Invariants`.
